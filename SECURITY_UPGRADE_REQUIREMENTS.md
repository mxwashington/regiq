# CRITICAL SECURITY UPGRADE REQUIREMENTS

## PostgreSQL Version Security Patches

### ⚠️ URGENT: PostgreSQL Version Has Security Vulnerabilities

**Status**: Current PostgreSQL version has available security patches that must be applied immediately.

### Required Actions

#### 1. Immediate Actions Required

**CRITICAL**: Upgrade your Supabase PostgreSQL database to the latest version to apply security patches.

- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Database security vulnerabilities remain unpatched
- **Urgency**: Apply within 7 days

#### 2. Upgrade Process

Follow the Supabase upgrade documentation:
```
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/upgrading
```

**Steps**:
1. Review current database version in Supabase dashboard
2. Check for available upgrades under Settings > Database
3. Schedule maintenance window (recommended: off-peak hours)
4. Create database backup before upgrade
5. Apply the PostgreSQL version upgrade
6. Test all application functionality after upgrade
7. Monitor for any issues for 24-48 hours post-upgrade

#### 3. Pre-Upgrade Checklist

- [ ] Backup all databases
- [ ] Document current PostgreSQL version
- [ ] Review breaking changes in upgrade notes
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of maintenance window

#### 4. Post-Upgrade Validation

After upgrading, verify the following:

- [ ] All database connections work properly
- [ ] All custom functions execute correctly
- [ ] RLS policies are still enforced
- [ ] Extensions are working (pgcrypto, uuid-ossp, pg_trgm, etc.)
- [ ] Application authentication works
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions work
- [ ] Background jobs/cron functions operate normally

#### 5. Security Validation Commands

Run these queries to verify security features are intact:

```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled on critical tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('alerts', 'profiles', 'supplier_watches', 'api_keys');

-- Verify extensions are in correct schema
SELECT extname, nspname as schema
FROM pg_extension e
JOIN pg_namespace n ON e.extnamespace = n.oid;

-- Check function security settings
SELECT
  p.proname,
  array_to_string(p.proconfig, ',') as settings
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
  AND p.proconfig IS NOT NULL
  AND 'search_path=public,extensions' = ANY(p.proconfig);
```

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting

After upgrade, monitor for:
- Database performance changes
- Connection issues
- Function execution errors
- Authentication problems
- API response times

### 7. Risk Assessment

**If upgrade is delayed**:
- **High Risk**: Database remains vulnerable to known security exploits
- **Compliance Risk**: May violate security compliance requirements
- **Operational Risk**: Potential for security breaches affecting customer data
- **Reputational Risk**: Data breaches could damage company reputation

### 8. Support and Escalation

If issues occur during or after upgrade:

1. **Immediate Issues**: Contact Supabase support immediately
2. **Application Issues**: Review application logs and database query logs
3. **Performance Issues**: Monitor query performance and connection pools
4. **Security Issues**: Re-run security validation commands above

### 9. Communication Plan

**Before Upgrade**:
- Notify all stakeholders 48 hours before maintenance
- Send reminder 2 hours before maintenance window
- Post maintenance notice on status page

**During Upgrade**:
- Post status updates every 30 minutes
- Notify when upgrade is complete
- Confirm all systems operational

**After Upgrade**:
- Send completion notification
- Provide summary of changes
- Document any issues encountered and resolutions

### 10. Rollback Plan

**If Critical Issues Occur**:
1. Document the specific issue
2. Contact Supabase support for rollback assistance
3. Restore from pre-upgrade backup if necessary
4. Implement temporary workarounds
5. Plan remediation strategy

### 11. Documentation Updates

After successful upgrade:
- [ ] Update system documentation with new PostgreSQL version
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Record lessons learned
- [ ] Update monitoring dashboards if needed
- [ ] Update backup/restore procedures if changed

## Additional Security Recommendations

### Database Security Hardening

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule quarterly security reviews
2. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Implement continuous security monitoring
3. **Access Control Reviews**: Quarterly review of user permissions and RLS policies
4. **Backup Security**: Ensure backups are encrypted and access-controlled
5. **Network Security**: Review firewall rules and VPC configurations

### Application Security

1. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all application dependencies current
2. **Code Security**: Regular security code reviews and SAST scanning
3. **Input Validation**: Continue using RegulatoryInputSanitizer consistently
4. **Authentication**: Regular review of authentication and authorization logic
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Maintain comprehensive security event logging
